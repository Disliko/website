      <h1>Privacy Policy for Disliko</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Effective Date:</strong> January 1, 2025
      </p>
      <p>
        At Disliko, we are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy
        Policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect your personal
        information when you use our service.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        Disliko only collects the website URL of the YouTube video you enter. We
        do not collect, store, or share any personally identifiable information
        (PII) such as your name, email address, or location. The URL is only
        used to fetch public data from YouTube.
      </p>

      <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <p>
        The only purpose for collecting the YouTube video URL is to retrieve
        public data regarding likes, dislikes, and views and other data
        associated with the video. We do not use this information for any other
        purpose, and it is not stored or shared beyond the service.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
      <p>
        Since we do not collect any personal information, we do not store any
        data related to your video searches. The URL is processed temporarily to
        fetch the relevant video data and is not saved on our servers.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>
        Disliko may rely on third-party services (such as YouTube API) to
        retrieve video data. These services may have their own privacy policies,
        and we encourage you to review them to understand how your data is
        handled.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Cookies and Tracking</h2>
      <p>
        We do not use cookies or any tracking mechanisms to collect any personal
        data or track your activities across websites.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be
        posted on this page with an updated effective date. By using our
        service, you agree to be bound by the updated Privacy Policy.
      </p>
